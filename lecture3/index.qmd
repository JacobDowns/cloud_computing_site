title: "Lecture 3 — Web & Network Fundamentals for the Cloud"

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## agenda.txt — Today’s plan

Today we’ll focus on the **web and networking fundamentals** that help explain what actually happens when you deploy an app to the cloud.

1. How web requests work (client → server)
2. DNS and naming
3. HTTP vs HTTPS
4. Public vs private exposure
5. Load balancers and “invisible infrastructure”
6. What really happened when you deployed to Firebase

## Why this lecture exists

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## context.exe — Connecting the dots

In Lab 1, you deployed a real web app and got a public URL.

This lecture answers the question:

**What actually happens between a browser and a cloud-hosted application?**

Understanding this makes later topics—security, CI/CD, databases, and cloud architecture—much easier to reason about.

## Clients, servers, and requests

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## request.exe — The core web model

At a high level, the web works like this:

- A **client** (usually a browser) sends a request
- A **server** receives the request
- The server sends back a response

This request–response pattern is the foundation of almost everything on the web.
:::

### Statelessness (important for cloud)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## stateless.dll — Why this matters

Most web requests are **stateless**:

- The server does not remember previous requests by default
- Each request must contain all the information needed to handle it

This property makes it much easier to:
- scale systems
- load-balance traffic
- replace failed servers

Cloud platforms are built around this idea.

## URLs and DNS: names before machines

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## dns.exe — How names become destinations

When you visit a URL like:

```
https://my-app.web.app
```

your computer does **not** know where that is yet.

It first asks the **Domain Name System (DNS)**:
> “What IP address corresponds to this name?”
:::

### Why DNS exists

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## phonebook.txt — The internet’s directory

DNS exists because:
- IP addresses are hard to remember
- Servers move and change
- Cloud services scale dynamically

Names stay stable even when the underlying infrastructure changes.

## HTTP vs HTTPS

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## http.exe — Talking to servers

**HTTP** defines how clients and servers communicate:
- request methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- headers
- responses and status codes
:::

### What HTTPS adds

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## https.exe — Security by default in the cloud

**HTTPS** adds two critical guarantees:

1. **Encryption** — others cannot read the traffic
2. **Identity** — you know who you are talking to

Modern cloud platforms typically provide HTTPS automatically.
:::

### Why this matters for cloud

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## tls.dll — Managed security

When you used Firebase Hosting:
- HTTPS was enabled by default
- Certificates were managed for you
- You didn’t configure encryption manually

This is an example of cloud providers **abstracting away complexity**.

## Public vs private: exposure as a design choice

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## exposure.exe — Who can reach your service?

In the cloud, one of the most important questions is:

**Should this service be reachable from the public internet?**
:::

### Why exposure matters

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
## risk.dll — Default assumptions

- Public services will be scanned
- Misconfigurations are common causes of breaches
- Security often starts with *network exposure*, not authentication

Cloud platforms force you to think explicitly about these boundaries.
:::

---

## Load balancers: the invisible middle

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## lb.exe — You rarely talk to a single server

In cloud systems:

- A single URL often represents **many machines**
- A **load balancer** sits in front of them
- Traffic is distributed automatically
:::

### Why load balancers matter

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## scale.dll — Reliability and elasticity

Load balancers enable:
- scaling up and down
- replacing failed servers
- zero-downtime updates

Most cloud platforms hide load balancers from you—but they’re still there.

## What actually happened when you deployed

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## lab1-review.exe — Putting it all together

When you deployed your app to Firebase:

1. You built static files (`dist/`)
2. Files were uploaded to Firebase Hosting
3. Firebase placed them behind:
   - a CDN
   - load balancers
   - HTTPS endpoints
4. DNS pointed your URL to that infrastructure

You didn’t configure these pieces—but you benefited from them.

## Key takeaways

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## takeaway.exe — Mental models to keep

- The web is request–response
- Names (DNS) matter more than machines
- HTTPS is the default, not a luxury
- Public vs private exposure is a design choice
- Cloud platforms hide infrastructure—but it still exists
:::

## Looking ahead

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## next.exe — Why this matters later

These ideas will come back when we discuss:
- security and misconfigurations
- CI/CD and automated deployments
- infrastructure as code
- databases and backend services

Understanding the network makes the cloud make sense.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## discussion.exe — Questions to think about

1. Which parts of this workflow did Firebase hide from you?
2. What risks are reduced by managed HTTPS and load balancers?
3. Where might you want *more* control instead of abstraction?
