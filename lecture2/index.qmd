## agenda.txt — Today’s plan

1.  **Quick review** of Lecture 1 (cloud big picture)
2.  **Firebase.exe:** What it is, what it can do, and why we’re using it
3.  **Alternatives.dll:** Other ways to host/deploy modern web apps
4.  **Vite.ts:** What it is and why our template uses it
5.  Transition into **Lab 1** (deploy your app to Firebase Hosting)

## Quick review: last lecture in 5 minutes

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## recap.exe — Big ideas to keep in your head

-   Cloud computing = **on-demand resources + self-service + elasticity + pay-as-you-go**
-   Service models: **IaaS / PaaS / SaaS** (boundaries blur)
-   Providers sell more than servers: compute, storage, databases, networking, observability, security
-   The key question: **“Who manages which layer?”**
:::

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## framing-question.exe

Before we touch tools, remember the “why”:

**If cloud is programmable infrastructure, what does that change about how we build and ship software?**
:::

## Firebase.exe — What is Firebase?

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## firebase.txt — One sentence definition

**Firebase is a developer platform** (from Google) that bundles common app needs—**hosting, authentication, databases, storage, messaging, analytics**, and more—behind friendly SDKs and a simple console.

### Why Firebase is a good first cloud tool

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## why-firebase.dll — Why we’re using it in Week 1

Firebase is great for learning because it gives you:

-   a **real deployment workflow** (build → deploy → public URL)
-   a **managed hosting service** (you don’t manage servers)
-   a path to deeper cloud ideas later (auth, DB, rules, functions, CI/CD)
:::

## What can Firebase do?

### 1) Hosting (what we’re using today)

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## hosting.exe — Firebase Hosting

Firebase Hosting is production-grade hosting for web content. In practice, it’s ideal for **static** sites and **single-page apps**, deployed to a global CDN with one command.

Key capabilities: - HTTPS by default - CDN caching for fast delivery - Simple deploy + rollback workflow
:::

**Today’s lab**: we will deploy the **Vite build output** (`dist/`) to Firebase Hosting.

### 2) Authentication (app sign-in)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## auth.dll — App sign-in (not “logging into Firebase”)

Firebase Authentication is a managed sign-in system (email/password, phone, and popular identity providers). This is authentication for *your app’s users*, not just your developer account.
:::

### 3) Databases (Firestore / Realtime Database)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## db.exe — Data in the cloud

Firebase includes managed databases commonly used from frontend apps:

-   **Cloud Firestore** (document/collection model)
-   **Realtime Database** (JSON tree model)

The key teaching concept later: **security rules** and “who can read/write what.”
:::

### 4) Storage (files)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## storage.bin — Images, files, uploads

Firebase Storage is for user-generated files: - images, videos, PDFs - “upload a profile picture” - “submit an assignment screenshot”
:::

### 5) Functions and dynamic backends (later)

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## functions.sys — Server-side code (later)

Firebase Hosting can be paired with Cloud Functions or Cloud Run for dynamic content and microservices.

We are **not** doing this today. Week 1 stays “hosting-only” so the workflow is simple.
:::

## Firebase vs other options (Alternatives.dll)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## alternatives.dll — Similar tools students will encounter

**Firebase Hosting** is one member of a bigger ecosystem of deployment options.
:::

| Tool / Platform | What it’s great for | What you give up | Typical “Week 1” use |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Firebase Hosting** | Static + SPA hosting with easy path to auth/DB later | More ecosystem lock-in once you adopt many Firebase services | Deploy Vite build (`dist/`) |
| **GitHub Pages** | Static sites and docs (very simple) | No backend, no DB/auth (without external services) | Host course sites / portfolios |
| **Vercel / Netlify** | “Deploy from Git” frontend workflows, previews, SSR support | Can get complex with quotas and build settings | Deploy React/Next apps |
| **Supabase** | Firebase-like experience but Postgres-centered | Different ecosystem and tradeoffs | DB + auth projects |
| **Cloudflare Pages** | Fast static deploys + edge options | Different mental model | Static + edge experiments |

## Vite.ts — What is Vite?

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## vite.txt — One sentence definition

**Vite is a frontend build tool** designed for a fast development experience: it runs a dev server with very fast hot-reload and produces an optimized production build.
:::

### The two Vite modes you should recognize

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## modes.dll — Dev vs Build

Vite has two “personalities”:

1.  **Dev mode**

    ``` bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Runs a local dev server with fast refresh.

2.  **Build mode**

    ``` bash
    npm run build
    ```

    Produces a production-ready static bundle (by default into `dist/`).
:::

### Why this matters for deployment

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## dist.exe — The key idea for today

**Firebase Hosting deploys files.** So we deploy the output of `npm run build`.

For Vite, that output folder is:

```         
dist/
```

This is why we set the Firebase Hosting “public directory” to `dist`.
:::


## Transition to Lab 1

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## launch.exe — What we’re about to do

In [lab 1](../lab1/index.qmd), you will:

1. Clone a git repo containing a simple [Vite app](https://github.com/Cloud-Course-Spring-2026/simple_firebase_app)
2.  Build the app (`npm run build`)
3.  Initialize Firebase Hosting (`firebase init hosting`)
    -   public directory = `dist`
    -   SPA rewrite = Yes
    -   GitHub deploys = No
4.  Deploy (`firebase deploy`)
5.  Submit your live URL
