title: "Lab 1 — Deploying a Web App to Firebase"
---

## Overview

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## lab1.exe — What you are doing

In this lab, you will deploy a simple web app to the cloud using **Firebase Hosting**.

By the end of this lab, you will have:

-   a locally running React + Vite app
-   a production build of that app
-   a public URL hosted on Firebase

This lab focuses on deployment concepts, not frontend development.

## Prerequisites

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
## prereq.dll — Required software

Before starting, make sure you have:

-   **Node.js (LTS)** installed\
    → https://nodejs.org\
-   **Git** installed\
-   A **GitHub account**
-   A **Google account** (for Firebase)

You will also need the **Firebase CLI**, which you will install below.
:::

## Step 0 — Accept the Assignment

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## classroom.exe — GitHub Classroom

1.  Click the GitHub Classroom assignment link.
2.  Accept the assignment.
3.  GitHub will create a **private repository** for you.
4.  Clone that repository to your computer.

``` bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
```
:::

## Step 1 — Install Dependencies and Run Locally

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## devserver.exe — Local development

Install dependencies:

``` bash
npm install
```

Start the local development server:

``` bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

You should see the starter app.
:::

## Step 2 — Make a Small Edit

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## edit.txt — Required change

Open `src/App.tsx` and make a **small visible change**, for example:

-   Add your name
-   Change the page title
-   Add a short sentence

Save the file and confirm the change appears in your browser.

This confirms:

-   your environment works
-   you can modify the app
:::

## Step 3 — Build the Production Version

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## build.exe — Creating deployable files

Stop the dev server (`Ctrl+C`), then run:

``` bash
npm run build
```

This creates a folder called:

```         
dist/
```

This folder contains the **static files** that will be deployed.

> **Important:** Firebase Hosting deploys the contents of `dist/`, not your source code.
:::

(Optional preview of the built site:)

``` bash
npm run preview
```

## Step 4 — Install and Log In to Firebase

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## firebase-cli.exe — Setup

Install the Firebase CLI:

``` bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Log in:

``` bash
firebase login
```

A browser window will open — sign in with your Google account.
:::

## Step 5 — Create a Firebase Project

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## project.exe — Cloud project

Go to the Firebase Console:

https://console.firebase.google.com

1.  Click **Add project**
2.  Give it a name (e.g., `cloud-lab1-yourname`)
3.  You can disable Google Analytics for this lab

Once created, return to your terminal.
:::

## Step 6 — Initialize Firebase Hosting

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## init.exe — This step matters

Run:

``` bash
firebase init hosting
```

Answer the prompts **exactly as follows**:

-   **Public directory:**

    ``` text
    dist
    ```

-   **Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all URLs to /index.html)?**

    ``` text
    Yes
    ```

-   **Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub?**

    ``` text
    No
    ```

-   **Overwrite dist/index.html?**

    ``` text
    No
    ```

This creates `firebase.json`.
:::

## Step 7 — Associate the Folder with Your Firebase Project

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## use.exe — Selecting the cloud project

Tell Firebase **which project to deploy to**:

``` bash
firebase use --add
```

-   Select the project you just created
-   Use the alias `default`

This creates `.firebaserc`.
:::

## Step 8 — Deploy to Firebase Hosting

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## deploy.exe — Going live

Every time you deploy, **build first**:

``` bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

When the command finishes, Firebase will print a URL like:

```         
https://<project-id>.web.app
```

Open it in your browser — your app should be live.
:::

## Step 9 — Verify and Reflect

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## checklist.txt — You are done if:

-   Your site loads at a Firebase URL
-   Your edit from Step 2 appears
-   You did **not** commit `dist/` to GitHub

Congratulations — you deployed a real cloud-hosted app.
:::

## Common Mistakes (Read This If Something Breaks)

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## errorlog.txt — Troubleshooting

**Site shows Firebase welcome page** - You did not set the public directory to `dist`

**Error: public directory does not exist** - Run `npm run build` before deploying

**React routes return 404** - You answered “No” to SPA rewrite — update `firebase.json`

**Permission errors** - Run `firebase logout` then `firebase login`
:::

## What You Just Learned (Preview)

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## takeaway.exe — Concepts

You practiced:

-   separating **source code** from **build artifacts**
-   deploying static assets to a managed cloud service
-   using a CLI to provision and manage cloud resources

Next, we’ll look at how to **automate this workflow** using GitHub Actions.
