## Week1.txt — Goals

By the end of Week 1 you should be able to explain:

-   what problems led to cloud computing
-   what changed to make cloud feasible at scale
-   IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS (and why boundaries blur)
-   the major players and what they sell
-   the shared responsibility model (first pass)

## The framing question

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## Question.exe

**Why did cloud computing emerge, and why did it replace traditional ways of running software?**
:::

## Before the cloud: what was hard?

-   Buying servers required capital and lead time
-   Scaling often took weeks or months
-   Ops work (patching, backups, networking, monitoring) slowed everything down
-   Capacity planning was a constant gamble

::: {.callout-caution collapse="false"}
## Common failure mode

**Overprovisioning** wastes money; **underprovisioning** causes outages. Cloud’s “elasticity” is largely an answer to this.

## What enabled the cloud?

Cloud wasn’t one invention — it was a convergence:

-   **Virtualization** (better utilization + isolation)
-   **Reliable networking** (remote resources feel close)
-   **Automation + APIs** (provision by software)
-   **Economies of scale** (specialized ops and bulk purchasing)

## A working definition

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing resources over the internet, typically with:

-   self-service provisioning
-   elastic scaling (up/down)
-   pay-as-you-go pricing
-   managed services that increase abstraction

## Service models: IaaS / PaaS / SaaS

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## Models.dll — “Who manages what?”

-   **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: you manage OS/runtime/app; provider manages physical infrastructure\
-   **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: you manage code+data; provider manages runtime/scaling/infrastructure\
-   **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: provider manages everything; you use the product
:::

| Service Model | What you manage | What the provider manages | Familiar examples students may know |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) | OS, runtime, application, data | Physical servers, storage, networking, virtualization | AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure Virtual Machines, DigitalOcean Droplets |
| **PaaS** (Platform as a Service) | Application code and data | OS, runtime, scaling, infrastructure | Firebase, Heroku, Google App Engine, Cloud Run, Vercel |
| **SaaS** (Software as a Service) | Configuration and usage | Everything (app, runtime, infra, scaling) | Gmail, Google Docs, GitHub, Slack, Canvas, Zoom |

### Reality check: boundaries blur

These categories are mental models, not strict boxes. A good question is always:

> “Who is responsible for which layer?”

## Major industry players

-   AWS
-   Microsoft Azure
-   Google Cloud

Also important in the ecosystem: - IBM, Oracle, Alibaba - DigitalOcean (developer-focused niche)

## What providers actually sell

Not just “servers”:

-   compute (VMs, containers, serverless)
-   storage (object/block/file)
-   databases (managed SQL/NoSQL)
-   networking (VPCs, load balancing)
-   observability (logging/monitoring)
-   security + identity tooling
-   data + ML platforms

## Shared responsibility model (first pass)

Providers secure the **cloud**. Customers secure what’s **in** the cloud.

Customer responsibilities often include: - IAM configuration and least privilege - data access controls - application vulnerabilities - secrets handling

## Discussion prompts

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Discussion.exe (click to expand)

1.  What’s the biggest risk of building systems only by clicking in a console?
2.  Where do you expect vendor lock-in to show up most?
3.  When is the cloud *not* the right choice?
